# Awesome - Most Cited and Impactful Papers on AI Video generation
A curated list of papers on video generation or editing using Generative Models such as Diffusion Models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), etc.

Though the name of the repo is `text-to-video`, all sorts of modalities to video such as `text+image` to video are also included and contributions are welcome.

The papers are grouped based on the main model architecture of the generative model. 

## Why this Awesome list 
This awesome list is created to help researchers and practisioners get up to speed with generative models for video generation and editing. Anyone getting started, say a new PhD student, should be able to make the most out of this repo.

## Contributing
If you have any suggestions (missing papers, new papers, key researchers or typos), please feel free to edit and send across a pull request.
